The error `Cannot open include file: 'juce_core/juce_core.h'` in `MIDIQy_Tests` indicates that the JUCE include directories are not being propagated from `MIDIQy_Core` to the Test executable.

This happens because `MIDIQy_Core` likely linked the JUCE libraries as `PRIVATE`. Since `MappingTypes.h` (part of Core) exposes JUCE types (like `juce::String`) in its header, the JUCE dependency must be **`PUBLIC`**.

### 🛠 Fix: Update CMakeLists.txt

**Target File:** `CMakeLists.txt`

**Task:**
1.  Locate the `target_link_libraries(MIDIQy_Core ...)` section.
2.  Change the scope of the JUCE libraries from `PRIVATE` (or default) to **`PUBLIC`**.

**Cursor Prompt:**

```cmake
# In CMakeLists.txt, locate the MIDIQy_Core linking section and update it to use PUBLIC.
# This ensures that any project linking against Core (like the Test App) also gets the JUCE headers.

target_link_libraries(MIDIQy_Core PUBLIC
    juce::juce_core
    juce::juce_events
    juce::juce_audio_basics
    juce::juce_audio_devices
    user32
    hid
    setupapi
)

# Also ensure MIDIQy_Tests links to the main app's include directories if it needs to find "JuceHeader.h"
# (Though ideally we should move away from JuceHeader.h in Core files, this fixes the immediate build error)
target_include_directories(MIDIQy_Tests PRIVATE
    ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/MIDIQy_artefacts/JuceLibraryCode
)
```

**Explanation of the Fix:**
1.  **`PUBLIC` Linking:** Tells CMake: "Anyone who uses `MIDIQy_Core` also needs the include paths for `juce::juce_core`." This fixes the `juce_core.h` not found error.
2.  **Include Directory:** `MappingTypes.h` includes `<JuceHeader.h>`. This file is auto-generated by the **GUI App** target (`MIDIQy`), not the Core library. By adding the artefact path to the Test app, we allow the test to find that header.
