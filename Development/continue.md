overhawl the configurator window

for CC, it would be useful if we added some previews of the general mapping of CC numbers.

## Regarding mouse/trackpage

what if we do this:
we visualize the trackpad finger position for each finger...?

then, what if we make a system:
1. always keep mouse pointer in a location (e.g. over the midi mini window) so that it cannot go out and click randomly.
2. in the meanwhile we can track fingers.
3. we can exit from that mouse lock state using a mapped command button in keyboard

Thank you... now that the compiler is unified and optimized, we need to make the logger optimized and unified too.

# DO NOW:



right.
we need to do the musical nuances and customizability that have, implement in core logic and test it.

can you please tell me your detailed understanding of the nuances that I have?
1. I have mappings. this is for singular thing. it has some types. the properties list change based on the type we choose
2. I have zones. this is group thing. assigned keys show similar trait. have A LOT of musical nuances. the chords, the grid system, and so much playing style and stuff. lots of customizability.

I need you to tell me your full understanding of the mappings first. then we will implement the test, code implementation, GUI linking etc all to finish it.
then we will start the same thing with zones.
we go slow, but we go accurate.

so, no prompt, give me detailed understanding of you about the mappings. every type, what the parameters are, what it does etc
