Now, we need to extend the types in touchpad entries.

1. we have the touchpad mixer entry (DONT CHANGE IT).
2. we will add a new entry: drum pad/launcher: user can determine how many rows/columns they want, and the midi note it should send (starting position). they will be able to do finger drumming. There will be base velocity and velocity random too.  customizable grid with customizable dead zones (if user wants to have dead zones on the edges of grid to prevent accidental triggers)

!!!DONE!!!

now, add more layout types
