now, we have to do an important thing.

currently the software detects all keystrokes. whether the application is in focus or not.
but we have to do this:
1. do a global shortcut binding (in settings panel tab)
2. e.g. Scroll lock on = Midi mode. keyboard device will be intercepted, and only midi will be sent. Scroll Lock off = no midi. no interception. keyboard works as expected,

is it possible?
and will it harm my performance optimizations?
