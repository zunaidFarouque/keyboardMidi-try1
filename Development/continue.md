please introduce state banks, and modifier keys.
for example, if I press "Q", it plays "C4". hold shift and play to play "C5". or "C4" in but another channel. or a CC, or command... or anything. or trigger something (e.g. set zone playmode to poly instead of mono)
basically shift or any other button could act as a way to modify.
so, there are a lot of possibilities.
now, we need a way to easily handle, manage and also visualize those modified state mappings...
even we can let users bind a zone to only a modified state. like that zone will be triggered only when in a certain modifier key is pressed.

there could also be banks. banks could be like a state of the layout/bindings. easily switch layout. open specific layout+binding instantly with just one button...

I dont know which will be better to implement first... we need to do brainstorming.

Thank you...

now, we need to improve the mappings window.

currently it has columns:
Key, Device, Type, Data1, Data2, Ch

Now, the key is stored like this:
"Laptop Keybord - Num 0",
"Laptop Keybord - Shift",
"Laptop Keybord - Q",
basically like this: [Alias Name] - [Key name]

but we dont need to show alias name there. we can see that in Device Column.

so, lets fix it.
