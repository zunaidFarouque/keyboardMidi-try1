now, we have to do an important thing.

currently the software detects all keystrokes. whether the application is in focus or not.
but we have to do this:
1. do a global shortcut binding 
2. e.g. Caps lock on = Midi mode. that specific keyboard device will be intercepted, and only midi will be sent. Caps Lock off = no midi. no interception. keyboard works as expected,

is it possible?
and will it harm my performance optimizations?
