pitch modulation/any modulation could have some resting place...
in the resting place the value wont change.
useful when bending pitch and pausing at specific pitch, if can pause at perfect position, it sounds good. thats tough, but with the help of resting spaces, it is easier.

ANNNNNNNNNNNNDDDD

pitch bend is not working properly

## Regarding mouse/trackpage

what if we do this:
we visualize the trackpad finger position for each finger...?

then, what if we make a system:
1. always keep mouse pointer in a location (e.g. over the midi mini window) so that it cannot go out and click randomly.
2. in the meanwhile we can track fingers.
3. we can exit from that mouse lock state using a mapped command button in keyboard
