please introduce state banks, and modifier keys.
for example, if I press "Q", it plays "C4". hold shift and play to play "C5". or "C4" in but another channel. or a CC, or command... or anything. or trigger something (e.g. set zone playmode to poly instead of mono)
basically shift or any other button could act as a way to modify.
so, there are a lot of possibilities.
now, we need a way to easily handle, manage and also visualize those modified state mappings...
even we can let users bind a zone to only a modified state. like that zone will be triggered only when in a certain modifier key is pressed.

there could also be banks. banks could be like a state of the layout/bindings. easily switch layout. open specific layout+binding instantly with just one button...

I dont know which will be better to implement first... we need to do brainstorming.

the keyboard visualizer should have alias-wise keyboard.
for example, I should be able to choose which keyboard mapping is being shown.
e.g. when I select the laptop keyboard to be shown, the keyboard mappings will be shown for laptop And the any/master aliases. that way it is easy to identify conflict.
if I select the external keyboard alias, the keyboard mappings will be shown for external And the any/master aliases.
if I select any/master alias, it will only show mapping for that only.
if I select ALL, it will show from all keyboards (starting from any/master bindings and going down chronologically. it will not try to override if a key already shows as "bound". )
