Migrate from Mappings Tab to Touchpad Tab.
> already discussing

use: @touchpad Mappings (current implementations).md file to add exact features in the touchpad tab.


===

We need to add a new type of touchpad layout: Encoders.
Encoders are important for many navigation stuff and other stuff.
We need to implement it

Currently, there is no way to visualize the other layers of mapping if not physically went there.
So, create a switch/checkbox that when enabled, shows the specific layer that has been selected.

example:
if this checkbox is selected:
if currently in the mappings tab, visualizer will show the currently selected layer in that tab
if currently in the zones tab, visualizer will show the layer which currently selected zone is bound to

so, add the checkbox/toggle swtich in appropriate place...


===

We need to add groups in keyboard mapping too.
hold a key to enable that group.
