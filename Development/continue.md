Determine how much calculation overhead happening because of the gredients, and how to solve the issue.

Currently, there is no way to visualize the other layers of mapping if not physically went there.
So, create a switch/checkbox that when enabled, shows the specific layer that has been selected.

example:
if this checkbox is selected:
if currently in the mappings tab, visualizer will show the currently selected layer in that tab
if currently in the zones tab, visualizer will show the layer which currently selected zone is bound to

so, add the checkbox/toggle swtich in appropriate place...

Today, there are groups in touchpad mappings.
We need to add groups in keyboard mapping too.
hold a key to enable that group, or press to latch that group.
there should be also a button to get out of any latches and go to the base layer (remove all groups/layers toggled on)
