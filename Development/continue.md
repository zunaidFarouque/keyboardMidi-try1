THE Window uses 10% of my CPU at all the time. even if I dont use it. this is huge! why is that?

please introduce state banks, and modifier keys.
for example, if I press "Q", it plays "C4". hold shift and play to play "C5". or "C4" in but another channel. or a CC, or command... or anything. or trigger something (e.g. set zone playmode to poly instead of mono)
basically shift or any other button could act as a way to modify.
so, there are a lot of possibilities.
now, we need a way to easily handle, manage and also visualize those modified state mappings...
even we can let users bind a zone to only a modified state. like that zone will be triggered only when in a certain modifier key is pressed.

there could also be banks. banks could be like a state of the layout/bindings. easily switch layout. open specific layout+binding instantly with just one button...

I dont know which will be better to implement first... we need to do brainstorming.
