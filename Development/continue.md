Now, we need to extend the types in touchpad..

what other things can we add that can utilize touchpad like this?
What I have in mind:
1. drum pad: user can determine how many rows/columns they want, and the midi note it should send (starting position). they will be able to do finger drumming. There will be base velocity and velocity random too. also, hold a thing and drag up to repeat note (like rolling, but in proper tempo snap like 1/8 or 1/16 etc...). customizable grid with customizable dead zones (if user wants to have dead zones on the edges of grid to prevent accidental triggers)
2. you give me more ideas. useful, musical, innovative
