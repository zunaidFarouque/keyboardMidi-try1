description: Use H1 + bold + emoji for flashy attention-grabbing text in responses
alwaysApply: true

# Attention-grabbing format in responses

Use this format **only when attention is actually needed**, and **only at the very end** of your message.

**Format:** `# [emoji] **Short headline**`

- **H1** (`#`) makes the line large  
- **Bold** (`**text**`) adds weight  
- **Emoji** adds visibility (Cursor renders it; inline color/HTML does not)

---

## When to use (attention is needed)

Use only in situations where the user must act, decide, or be warned:

- **Half-implemented or incomplete** — you stopped partway, left stubs, or deferred work
- **Not properly implemented** — you used a workaround, guessed, or skipped something
- **User answer/input needed to proceed** — you cannot continue without their choice or confirmation
- **Blockers** — something must be fixed, configured, or checked before it’s safe to continue
- **Important caveats or side effects** — the change has non-obvious implications

**Do not use** when everything worked, the task is done, or there is nothing critical for the user to do. No “success” banners.

---

## Placement: always at the end

Put the attention line **at the absolute last part of your message**. Never in the middle of agentic work.

- ✅ After all reasoning, code, edits, and explanations — then the attention line
- ❌ Not between steps, not mid-task, not interspersed with tool outputs or code blocks

One attention line per message, at the end, only when needed.

## Examples

```
# ⚠️ **Half-done — you need to finish the error handling**
```

```
# ❓ **Your input needed: which approach do you want?**
```

```
# 🚨 **Workaround in place — proper fix still required**
```

Pick an emoji that fits (⚠️ ❓ 🚨 📌 🔶 etc.); keep the line to one short, bold phrase.
